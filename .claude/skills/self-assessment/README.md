# Self-Assessment & Learning Path Advisor

> Comprehensive Claude Code proficiency assessment that evaluates 10 feature areas, identifies skill gaps, and generates a personalized learning path to level up.

## Highlights

- Two assessment modes: Quick (8 questions, 2 min) and Deep (5 rounds, 5 min)
- Evaluates 10 feature areas: Slash Commands, Memory, Skills, Hooks, MCP, Subagents, Checkpoints, Advanced Features, Plugins, CLI
- Per-topic scoring with mastery levels (None / Basic / Proficient)
- Gap analysis with dependency-aware prioritization
- Personalized learning path with specific exercises and success criteria
- Follow-up actions: start learning, deep dive, practice project, or retake

## When to Use

| Say this... | Skill will... |
|---|---|
| "assess my level" | Run the assessment quiz and determine your level |
| "where should I start" | Evaluate your experience and suggest a starting point |
| "check my skills" | Produce a detailed skill profile across all 10 areas |
| "what should I learn next" | Identify gaps and build a prioritized learning path |
